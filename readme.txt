== Description ==

**Deprecated** Enable WordPress to send e-mail via SMTP instead of via PHP's mail() function (aka sendmail).

**NOTE: This plugin is no longer necessary as of WordPress 2.2 as SMTP was then built into WordPress. Please refer to my [Configure SMTP](http://coffee2code.com/wp-plugins/configure-smtp/) for the successor to this plugin, which allows you to configure the SMTP settings, including sending e-mail via SSL/TLS (such as through GMail).**

== Installation ==

1. This plugin has been deprecated and is no longer supported. It only works for versions of WordPress older than 2.2, none of which you really shouldn't be using anymore.
